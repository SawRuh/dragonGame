For the first project, I have learnt and utilised fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I learnt how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

I have started off by building the HTML and CSS structure inside the freeCodeCamp editor. Then I moved onto building out the JavaScript functionality.
